# Hi there 👋

## About me

Programming is my job and my hobby. I like to learn and put into practice what I am studying and sometimes I end up creating a library or project to capture what I have learned.

In my work I perform management, infrastructure and associated development tasks for different businesses. Which I enjoy a lot.

In my free time I dedicate myself to researching, studying and putting into practice different topics. and I do it without rushing with the sole objective of learning. Many times I end up applying what I learn later at work.

For obvious reasons I cannot share work developments but I can share my developments in my free time.

## My Main Projects

The following are the projects I have worked on and that I consider most relevant.

### [λORM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lambdaorm)

λORM is an ORM that allows us to perform distributed queries on different database engines.

In λORM, queries are defined using lambda expressions based on a domain model which abstracts us from the infrastructure. For example, in a query you can obtain or modify records from different entities, where some persist in MySQL, others in Postgres, and others in Mongo.

λORM allows you to define different scenarios for the same domain. For example, in one scenario, the infrastructure may consist of distributed instances across SQL Server, MongoDB, and Oracle, while in another scenario it may be a single Postgres instance.

- [λORM CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lambdaorm-cli): Command line interface for λORM
- [λORM ApiRest](https://github.com/lambda-orm/lambdaorm-svc): Rest API for λORM
- [λORM Client Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lambdaorm-client-node): Client for λORM ApiRest
- [λORM Labs](https://github.com/lambda-orm/lambdaorm-labs): Labs for λORM

### [3xpr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/3xpr)

3xpr is an extensible expression evaluator and parser.
Besides the operators, functions, variables, objects and arrays that are supported.
It is possible to extend it with your own functions, operators, etc.

### [typ3s](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typ3s)

The objective of this library is to obtain the type of an object, array, function, etc.
Also be able to obtain information about the cardinality of the data.

### [Json Light](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-light)

Json Light is a json compressor, generating a new simplified json file from a type definition.
The type can be written by us or generated by the library itself.
Json Light extracts the property tags from a json object and stores the values in an array

### [H3lp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/h3lp)

H3lp is a library that contains various helper methods for objects, arrays, strings, files and others.
It has the peculiarity that it is extensible and new groups of functions can be added.

### [Config Extends](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config-extends)

Allow to extend json or yaml/json files configuration
